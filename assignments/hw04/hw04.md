## Question 01


> Suppose the numbers of calories in 10 different brands of chocolate milk of $244 mL$ are: $164,182,176,149,184,190,160,139,175,148$. Assume these numbers are the observed values from a random sample of ten independent normal random variables with mean $μ$ and variance $σ^2$, both unknown. Find a $95%$ confidence interval for the mean calories $μ$.


---

Confidence intervals are calculated using the formula:

$$
\bar{X} \pm k \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

When the population standard deviation is unknown, the sample standard deviation, $s$, is used instead.

The sample standard deviation of a sample is found using:

$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})^2}{n-1}}
$$

For this sample:

$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{(164-166.7)^2 + (182-166.7)^2 + (176-166.7)^2 + (149-166.7)^2 + (184-166.7)^2 + (190-166.7)^2 + (160-166.7)^2 + (139-166.7)^2 + (175-166.7)^2 + (148-166.7)^2}{9}} = 16.9
$$

When the population mean is unknown, the t-distribution is used to calculate the critical value. Thus, the formula for the confidence interval becomes:

$$
\bar{X} \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

To calculate the critical value $t_{\alpha/2, n-1}$, we can use the inverse cumulative distribution function of the t-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom and a significance level of $\alpha/2$:

$$
t_{\alpha/2, n-1} = t_{0.025, 9} = 2.262
$$

The sample mean is calculated as:

$$
\bar{X} = \frac{164 + 182 + 176 + 149 + 184 + 190 + 160 + 139 + 175 + 148}{10} = 166.7
$$



Substituting the values into the formula for the confidence interval:

$$
166.7 \pm 2.262 \times \frac{16.9}{\sqrt{10}} \approx \boxed{(154.762, 178.638)}
$$


## Question 02

> Let $X_1, \dots ,X_n$ be a random sample from the normal distribution with unknown mean $μ$ and known variance $σ^2$. How large a random sample must be taken so that $90\%$ confidence interval has length less than $0.02σ$?

---

The length of the confidence interval is given by:

$$
2 \times k \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

Where $k$ is the critical value of the distribution. 

Since the population variance is known, extra variability is already accounted for and the z-distribution can be used for the test statistic. The critical value for a $90\%$ confidence interval is:

$$
z_{0.05} = 1.645
$$

Substituting the values into the formula for the confidence interval length:

$$
2 \times 1.645 \times \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} < 0.02\sigma
$$

Solving for $n$:

$$
\sqrt{n} > \frac{2 \times 1.645}{0.02} = 164.5 \implies n > 164.5^2 \approx 27060.25
$$

Therefore, a random sample of at least $\boxed{27061}$ observations must be taken to ensure that the $90\%$ confidence interval has a length less than $0.02\sigma$.


## Question 03

> Consider the setting in question 1, except that we now assume a known variance of $σ^2 = 16$. Suppose we wish to test the hypotheses: $H_0: μ = 170, H_A: μ \neq 170$. Determine whether the test rejects $H_0$ at significance $0.05$.

---

Since the variance is known, the z-distribution can be used to calculate the test statistic:

$$
z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{166.7 - 170}{\frac{4}{\sqrt{10}}} = -1.75
$$

We can find the probability of observing a value less than or equal to $-1.75$ in the standard normal distribution:

$$
P(Z \leq -1.75) = 0.0401
$$

Thus, the minimum probability such that the null hypothesis can be rejected is $0.0401$. Since $0.0401 < 0.05$, we can reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ at a significance level of $0.05$.

## Question 04

> Suppose that nine observations are selected at random from the normal distribution with unknown mean $μ$ and unknown variance $σ^2$, and for these nine observations it is found that $X_n = 20$ and $∑n i=1(X_i −X _n)^2 = 70$. Find p-value of the test with hypotheses: $H_0 : μ ≤ 18, H_A : μ > 18$.

---

The variance is given as:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})^2 = 70
$$

To find the sample standard deviation, we can use the formula:

$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})^2}{n-1}}
$$

Substituting the values:

$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{70}{9-1}} = \sqrt{\frac{70}{8}} = \sqrt{8.75} = 2.96
$$

To find the test statistic, we should use the t-distribution since the population variance is unknown. The value is given by:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{20 - 18}{\frac{2.96}{\sqrt{9}}} = \frac{2}{0.987} = 2.03
$$

The probability of obtaining this test statistic or a more extreme value (since $H_0$ is $μ ≤ 18$, "more extreme" means greater than $2.03$) can be found using the t-distribution with $n-1 = 8$ degrees of freedom:

$$
P(T > 2.03) \approx 0.038
$$

The minimum probability such that the null hypothesis can be rejected is $0.038$. Therefore the p-value of the test is $\boxed{0.038}$.

## Question 05

> An experiment is carried out to see if there is any relation between a person’s age and whether the person actively uses social media. Suppose that 100 people, 18 years of age or older, are selected at random, and each person is classified according to whether or not they are between 18 and 30 years of age and also according to whether or not they actively use social media. The observed numbers are given in the table below. Test the hypothesis that there is no relationship between a person’s age and whether they actively use social media.

---

| | Active social media user | Not active social media user | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Between 18 and 30 | 18 | 26 | 44 |
| Over 30 | 8 | 48 | 56 |
| Total | 26 | 74 | 100 |


The test is:

$$
H_0: \text{There is no relationship between a person's age and whether they actively use social media}
$$

$$
H_A: \text{There is a relationship between a person's age and whether they actively use social media}
$$

We will use a significance level of $0.05$.

Since we are testing categorical data, we can use the chi-squared test. The test statistic is given by:

$$
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{r} \sum_{j=1}^{c} \frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}
$$

Where:

- $O_{ij}$ is the observed frequency in cell $(i, j)$
- $E_{ij}$ is the expected frequency in cell $(i, j)$
- $r$ is the number of rows
- $c$ is the number of columns


Since the events are independent, the expected frequency for each cell in the table can be calculated as:

$$
E_{ij} = \frac{R_i \times C_j}{N}
$$

Where:

- $R_i$ is the total of row $i$
- $C_j$ is the total of column $j$
- $N$ is the total number of observations.

Table of expected frequencies:

| | Active social media user | Not active social media user | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Between 18 and 30 | 11.44 | 32.56 | 44 |
| Over 30 | 14.56 | 41.44 | 56 |
| Total | 26 | 74 | 100 |

Substituting the values into the formula for the chi-squared test statistic:

$$
\chi^2 = \frac{(18 - 11.44)^2}{11.44} + \frac{(26 - 32.56)^2}{32.56} + \frac{(8 - 14.56)^2}{14.56} + \frac{(48 - 41.44)^2}{41.44} \approx 9.078
$$


The degrees of freedom for the chi-squared test is given by:

$$
df = (r - 1) \times (c - 1) = (2 - 1) \times (2 - 1) = 1
$$


The p-value for the chi-squared test can be found using the chi-squared distribution with $1$ degree of freedom:

$$
P(\chi^2 > 9.078) \approx 0.0026
$$


Since $0.0026 < 0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ at a significance level of $0.05$. Therefore, there is evidence to suggest that there is a relationship between a person's age and whether they actively use social media.



## Question 06

> What is the most common speaker occupation in the dataset?

---



```python
import pandas as pd
import json

CSV = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpethe/TED_Talks/master/ted_main.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(CSV)

df['speaker_occupation'].value_counts().idxmax()
# >>> 'Writer'
```

The most common speaker occupation in the dataset is `Writer`.


## Question 07

> Drop a column from the dataframe that is uninformative (information already contained in other columns), so that the dataframe no longer contains that column.
>
>


---



```python
if 'name' in df.columns:
  df.drop('name', axis=1, inplace=True)
```

The column `name` is uninformative because it is just a concatenation of the `main_speaker` and the `title` columns and therefore redundant. Therefore, I have dropped the `name` column from the dataframe.


## Question 08

> Get the rows corresponding to talks about climate change.


---


```python
talks_abt_climate_change = df[df["tags"].apply(lambda x: "climate change" in x)]
talks_abt_climate_change
```

There are 87 rows corresponding to talks about climate change:

## Question 10

> Which talk is the most viewed as compared to its *related talks* (the one with the maximum difference between its views and the *view count* of any of its *related talks*)?

---


```python
import ast

def compute_related_diff(row):
    related_views = []
    for related in ast.literal_eval(row["related_talks"]):
        related_views.append(df[df["title"] == related["title"]]["views"].values[0])
    return max([row["views"] - x for x in related_views]) if related_views else 0

df["related_diff"] = df.apply(compute_related_diff, axis=1)

# Sort DataFrame by the computed difference in descending order
df = df.sort_values(by="related_diff", ascending=False)

df.iloc[0][:-1]
```

The talk with the most viewed related talk is *Do schools kill creativity?* by Sir Ken Robinson.

## Question 11

> Which pair of features (columns) are the most correlated? Comment on whether the correlation implies causation in this case with a few sentences


---


```python
max_correlated, max_correlation = max(
    [
        ((col1, col2), df[col1].corr(df[col2]))
        for col1 in df.select_dtypes(exclude="object").columns
        for col2 in df.select_dtypes(exclude="object").columns
        if col1 != col2
    ],
    key=lambda x: x[1],
)
max_correlated, max_correlation
# >> (('related_diff', 'views'), 0.9784920041585558)
```

The two features that are most correlated are `related_diff` and `views` with a correlation coefficient of `0.9784920041585558`

The correlation in this case does not imply causation. Both dates are bound by a shared timeline rather than a causal relationship. The film date doesnt cause the publication; rather, both variables are dependent on decisions made within a larger production process. The dates being sequential makes them correlated but this correlation merely relfects that they are part of a shared timeline -- not that one event is causing the other.


## Question 12

> Research a way to find out the significance (in terms of p-value) of the correlation of a pair of features. Try it on the pair of columns *duration* and *comments*. What is the correlation coefficient and its p-value? Comment on what this finding implies with a few sentences

---


```python
from scipy.stats import pearsonr

correlation, p_value = pearsonr(df["duration"], df["comments"])

print(f"Correlation {correlation:.4f}\np-value: {p_value:.13f}")
# >> Correlation 0.1407
# >> p-value: 0.0000000000010
```

The correlation coefficient between the `duration` and `comments` columns is `0.1407`.

The p-value is about `0.0000000000010`.

The p-value here represents the probability under the null hypothesis (the two features are uncorrelated) of obtaining a correlation as or more extreme than the one computed from the datasets. 

Since the probability of obtaining a correlation of 0.1407 is ~0.0000000000010, it's safe to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the correlation between duration and comments is statistically significant. I.e., the correlation is not due to random chance and exists earnestly in the population of TED talks.
