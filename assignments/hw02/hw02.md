> 
> (Recall that $P(A,B)$ is represented by 4 numbers: $P(A = 0, B = 0)$, $P(A = 0, B = 1)$, $P(A = 1, B = 0)$, $P(A = 1, B = 1)$.)

-------

The marginal pmf of two discrete random variables $A$ and $B$ is the sum of the joint pmf $f(A, B, C)$ over all possible values of $C$ for each combination of $A$ and $B$. This is given by:

$$
f_{A,B}(a, b) = \sum_{\forall c} f(a, b, c)
$$

Since the table provides the probability of each joint event of $A$, $B$, and $C$, we can directly calculate the marginal pmf of $A$ and $B$ by summing the joint pmf over all values of $C$.

### Calculation of $P(A, B)$:

For $A = 0, B = 0$:

$$
f_{A,B}(0, 0) = f(0, 0, 0) + f(0, 0, 1) = 0.01 + 0.07 = 0.08
$$

For $A = 0, B = 1$:

$$
f_{A,B}(0, 1) = f(0, 1, 0) + f(0, 1, 1) = 0.02 + 0.10 = 0.12
$$

For $A = 1, B = 0$:

$$
f_{A,B}(1, 0) = f(1, 0, 0) + f(1, 0, 1) = 0.02 + 0.30 = 0.32
$$

For $A = 1, B = 1$:

$$
f_{A,B}(1, 1) = f(1, 1, 0) + f(1, 1, 1) = 0.04 + 0.44 = 0.48
$$

### Conclusion:

Therefore, the marginal pmf of $A$ and $B$ is:

$$
f_{A,B}(a, b) =
\begin{cases}
0.08 & \text{if } a = 0, b = 0 \\
0.12 & \text{if } a = 0, b = 1 \\
0.32 & \text{if } a = 1, b = 0 \\
0.48 & \text{if } a = 1, b = 1
\end{cases}
$$


## Question 2

> By direct calculation compute the marginals $P(A)$ and $P(B)$.

-------

To find the marginal pmf of $A$, we sum the joint pmf $f(A, B, C)$ over all possible values of $B$ and $C$ for each value of $A$. Similarly, to find the marginal pmf of $B$, we sum the joint pmf $f(A, B, C)$ over all possible values of $A$ and $C$ for each value of $B$.

### Calculation of $P(A)$:

For $A = 0$:

$$
f_A(0) = f(0, 0, 0) + f(0, 0, 1) + f(0, 1, 0) + f(0, 1, 1) = 0.01 + 0.07 + 0.02 + 0.10 = 0.20
$$

For $A = 1$:

$$
f_A(1) = f(1, 0, 0) + f(1, 0, 1) + f(1, 1, 0) + f(1, 1, 1) = 0.02 + 0.30 + 0.04 + 0.44 = 0.80
$$

### Calculation of $P(B)$:

For $B = 0$:

$$
f_B(0) = f(0, 0, 0) + f(1, 0, 0) + f(1, 0, 1) + f(0, 0, 1) = 0.01 + 0.02 + 0.30 + 0.07 = 0.40
$$

For $B = 1$:

$$
f_B(1) = f(0, 1, 0) + f(1, 1, 0) + f(1, 1, 1) + f(0, 1, 1) = 0.02 + 0.04 + 0.44 + 0.10 = 0.60
$$

### Conclusion:

Therefore, the marginal pmf of $A$ and $B$ is:

$$
f_A(a) =
\begin{cases}
0.20 & \text{if } a = 0 \\
0.80 & \text{if } a = 1
\end{cases}
$$

$$
f_B(b) =
\begin{cases}
0.40 & \text{if } b = 0 \\
0.60 & \text{if } b = 1
\end{cases}
$$


## Question 3

> Are the random variables $A$ and $B$ independent? Why or why not?

Two random variables $A$ and $B$ are independent if and only if their joint pmf is the product of their marginal pmfs for all possible values of $A$ and $B$. In other words, $A$ and $B$ are independent if:

$$
f_{A, B}(a, b) = f_A(a) \cdot f_B(b)
$$

for all possible values of $A$ and $B$. This definition implies that the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other event.

To check if $A$ and $B$ are independent, we compare the joint pmf $f_{A, B}(a, b)$ with the product of the marginal pmfs $f_A(a) \cdot f_B(b)$ for all possible values of $A$ and $B$:

For $A = 0, B = 0$:

$$
f_{A, B}(0, 0) = 0.08 = 0.20 \cdot 0.40 = 0.08
$$

For $A = 0, B = 1$:

$$
f_{A, B}(0, 1) = 0.12 = 0.20 \cdot 0.60 = 0.12
$$

For $A = 1, B = 0$:

$$
f_{A, B}(1, 0) = 0.32 = 0.80 \cdot 0.40 = 0.32
$$

For $A = 1, B = 1$:

$$
f_{A, B}(1, 1) = 0.48 = 0.80 \cdot 0.60 = 0.48
$$

Since for all possible values of $A$ and $B$, $f_{A, B}(a, b) = f_A(a) \cdot f_B(b)$, the random variables $A$ and $B$ are **independent**.

## Question 4

> Compute the conditional distribution $P(A, B | C)$. 
> 
> Note that this includes computing $P(A, B | C = 0)$ as well as $P(A, B | C = 1)$, each of which is represented by 4 numbers (in total 8 numbers).

A conditional probability for two random variables $X$ and $Y$ is given by:

$$
P(X | Y) = \frac{P(X, Y)}{P(Y)}
$$

where $P(X, Y)$ is the joint probability of $X$ and $Y$, and $P(Y)$ is the marginal probability of $Y$.

Extending this to three random variables $A$, $B$, and $C$, the conditional probability $P(A, B | C)$ is given by:

$$
P(A, B | C = c) = \frac{P(A, B, C = c)}{P(C = c)}
$$

where $P(A, B, C)$ is the joint probability of $A$, $B$, and $C$, and $P(C)$ is the marginal probability of $C$.

#### Calculate the marginal probability of $C$

For $C = 0$:

$$
f_C(0) = f(0, 0, 0) + f(1, 0, 0) + f(1, 1, 0) + f(0, 1, 0) = 0.01 + 0.02 + 0.04 + 0.02 = 0.09
$$

Since $C$ is a binary random variable, $P(C = 1) = 1 - P(C = 0) = 1 - 0.09 = 0.91$.

#### Calculate the conditional probability of $A, B | C$

For $A = 0, B = 0, C = 0$:

$$
f(0, 0, 0) = 0.01 \implies f(0, 0 | 0) = \frac{f(0, 0, 0)}{f_C(0)} = \frac{0.01}{0.09} = 0.1111
$$

For $A = 0, B = 0, C = 1$:

$$
f(0, 0, 1) = 0.07 \implies f(0, 0 | 1) = \frac{f(0, 0, 1)}{f_C(1)} = \frac{0.07}{0.91} = 0.0769
$$

For $A = 0, B = 1, C = 0$:

$$
f(0, 1, 0) = 0.02 \implies f(0, 1 | 0) = \frac{f(0, 1, 0)}{f_C(0)} = \frac{0.02}{0.09} = 0.2222
$$

For $A = 0, B = 1, C = 1$:

$$
f(0, 1, 1) = 0.10 \implies f(0, 1 | 1) = \frac{f(0, 1, 1)}{f_C(1)} = \frac{0.10}{0.91} = 0.1099
$$

For $A = 1, B = 0, C = 0$:

$$
f(1, 0, 0) = 0.02 \implies f(1, 0 | 0) = \frac{f(1, 0, 0)}{f_C(0)} = \frac{0.02}{0.09} = 0.2222
$$

For $A = 1, B = 0, C = 1$:

$$
f(1, 0, 1) = 0.30 \implies f(1, 0 | 1) = \frac{f(1, 0, 1)}{f_C(1)} = \frac{0.30}{0.91} = 0.3297
$$

For $A = 1, B = 1, C = 0$:

$$
f(1, 1, 0) = 0.04 \implies f(1, 1 | 0) = \frac{f(1, 1, 0)}{f_C(0)} = \frac{0.04}{0.09} = 0.4444
$$

For $A = 1, B = 1, C = 1$:

$$
f(1, 1, 1) = 0.44 \implies f(1, 1 | 1) = \frac{f(1, 1, 1)}{f_C(1)} = \frac{0.44}{0.91} = 0.4835
$$

### Conclusion:

Therefore, the conditional pmf of $A$ and $B$ given $C$ is:

$$
f_{A,B|C}(a, b | c) =
\begin{cases}
0.1111 & \text{if } a = 0, b = 0, c = 0 \\
0.0769 & \text{if } a = 0, b = 0, c = 1 \\
0.2222 & \text{if } a = 0, b = 1, c = 0 \\
0.1099 & \text{if } a = 0, b = 1, c = 1 \\
0.2222 & \text{if } a = 1, b = 0, c = 0 \\
0.3297 & \text{if } a = 1, b = 0, c = 1 \\
0.4444 & \text{if } a = 1, b = 1, c = 0 \\
0.4835 & \text{if } a = 1, b = 1, c = 1
\end{cases}
$$
